Assignment 2: Encrypted Arduino Communication - Part 1


Included Files:
	*encrypted_communication_part1.cpp
        *Makefile
	*README

Accessories:
	*2x Arduino Mega Boards
	*Breadboard
	*5x Wire for Arduino
	*550k ohm resistor
	*USB cables for Arduinos from kits

Wiring Instructions:
	*Arduino1 TX3 <---> Arduino2 RX3
	*Arduino1 RX3 <---> Arduino2 TX3
	*Arduino1 GND <---> Arduino2 GND
	*Arduino1 Pin13 <---> Arduino1 GND (Client)
	*Arduino2 5V <---> 550k ohm resistor <---> Arduino2 Pin13 (Server)

Running Instructions:
 	1) Open 2 terminal windows and in both, navigate to the folder where your program and Makefile is stored.
 	2) Make sure both the Arduinos are connected to your laptop, and that both of them are using the proper serial ports.
	3) In the first terminal, type in: make upload-0 && serial-mon-0. 
	4) In the other terminal, type in: make upload-1 && serial-mon-1. 
 	5) This will compile the program, upload it to the arduino, and open the serial monitor.
 	6) The server and client will be identified, and you may now begin chatting!

Notes and Assumptions:
The program seems to work fine. However, when typing is done at a fast rate, the chat seems to delay or even stop working. This is because of a buffer overflow and from what we know, we are not being tested on this.
As long as typing is done at a normal pace, the program seems to work just fine.
