Weekly Exercise #7: Eulerâ€™s Phi Function

Description:
	This file contains functions that can calculate the Euler totient value of any given positive interger n value upto 32 bits (used in RSA encryption). It also calculates the probability of getting good "e" values, such that gcd(e,phi(n))=1.

Included Files:
	* eulerphi.cpp
	* README

Running Instructions:
	1. Copy eulerphi.cpp to a directory.
	2. Open a terminal on Linux and browse to that directory.
	3. To compile, run the following command:
		g++  eulerphi.cpp -o eulerphi
	4. To run, run the following command:
		./ eulerphi
	5. Then, enter your number.
	6. The program will print n, phi(n), phi(n)/n.
	7. It will also do a 15-bit test if the number you entered is greater or equal to 2^15.

Assumtions:
	1. Number inputted by user shall be an interger greater than 0.

Note:
	1. gcd() function used was referenced from eClass. It uses a fast Euclid algorithm, improving its efficiency.
