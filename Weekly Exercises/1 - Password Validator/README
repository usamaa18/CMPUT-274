Weekly Exercise 1: Password Validator

Description:
	This program first asks for a password input from user and classfies it into "Invalid", "Secure" or "Insecure" based on parameters given on eClass.
	Then, it asks for number input n from user and generates a valid, "Secure" password of length n.

Included Files:
	* validator.py
	* README

Running Instructions:
	1. Open a terminal on Linux and browse to directory containing validator.py
	2. Run the following command:
		python3 validator.py
	3. Follow the on-screen instructions

Assumtions:
	1. Assumes that the user inputs only numerical characters for password generation. The program is not designed to handle an unexpected data type input.

Note:
	1. Each character type (UpperAlpha, LowerAlpha, Numeric, SpecialChars) has a 0.25 probabilty of being generated. But the position is completely random.
	2. This code could also be varied so that each character type is given a probability of generation that is proportional to the number of characters in that type with resepect to total number of characters.
	3. It could also be varied to eliminate the while loop (line 78) that ensures that the generated password is in fact secure. The added complexity is not worth this program's expected use-case.
