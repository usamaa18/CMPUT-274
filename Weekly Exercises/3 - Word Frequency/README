Weekly Exercise 3: Word Frequency

Description:
	This program takes in 'filename' as a command line arguement, reads that file, counts the number of words in the file and generates a resultant file 'filename.out'. The resultant file contains an alphabetically ordered list of unique words, their raw frquencies and their relative frequencies wrt total word count.

Included Files:
	* freq.py
	* README

Running Instructions:
	1. Open a terminal on Linux and browse to directory containing freq.py
	2. Run the following command:
		python3 freq.py <input_file_name>
	3. <input_file_name> should be replaced by the name of the file you wish to read.
	4. File should exist in the same directory as freq.py.
	5. If the program runs error-free, a results file named <input_file_name>.out will be created.

Assumtions:
	1. Assumes that the input file is the same directory as freq.py
	2. Assumes that the input file will be in plaintext.

Note:
	1. If <input_file_name>.out already exists, it will be cleared and replaced.
	2. Relative frequency is based on number of occurence of unique word and total number of words in file. Any scaling factor with decimal points is rounded to 3 decimal points using round() function.
	3. Output file will be in plaintext.
