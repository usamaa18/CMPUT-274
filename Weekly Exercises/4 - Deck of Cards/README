Weekly Exercise 4: Deck of Cards

Description:
	This program takes in 'filename' as a command line arguement, reads that file, converts the data into an object of deck of cards. It checks a few conditions: 
		1) Deck should contain exactly 52 cards
		2) Each card should be of valid type (valid rank and suite)
		3) Each card should only occur once
	If the conditions are met, the prgram plays a game of High Card Draw.

Included Files:
	* deck.py
	* README

Running Instructions:
	1. Open a terminal on Linux and browse to directory containing deck.py
	2. Run the following command:
		python3 deck.py <input_file_name>
	3. <input_file_name> should be replaced by the name of the file you wish to read.
	4. File should exist in the same directory as deck.py.
	5. If <input_file_name> is correctly formatted and contains a valid deck of cards, a 26 rounds of High Card Draw will be simulated.

Assumtions:
	1. Assumes that the input file is the same directory as deck.py
	2. Assumes that the input file will be in plaintext.
	3. Assumes that only one card will exist on each line in file.
	4. Assumes that card suite does not matter in High Card Draw.

Note:
	1. Function __str__() in class Deck is defined but never called.
	2. Number of rounds played depends on number of cards in deck, but it is always 26 because we use validate() before running play().
