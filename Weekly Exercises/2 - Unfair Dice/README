Weekly Exercise 2: Unfair Dice

Description:
	This program first inputs list of probabilities (prob_list), seed (seed), and sample size (n) from user. It generates and prints a list (rolls), which is a random (based on seed inputted) list of n values that simulate the rolling of a biased die (based on prob_list).

	Then, it inputs an interger (width) from user and prints a histogram of "rolls", scaling it so that the mode of "rolls" is "width" characters long.

Included Files:
	* unfairDice.py
	* README

Running Instructions:
	1. Open a terminal on Linux and browse to directory containing unfairDice.py
	2. Run the following command:
		python3 unfairDice.py
	3. Follow the on-screen instructions

Assumtions:
	1. Assumes that the user inputs only numerical characters throughout the program. The program is not designed to handle an unexpected data type input.
	2. Assumes that inputted list of probabilties sum up to 1.0 and that all probabilites are floating point values between 0 and 1.
	3. Assumes that the dice is labelled 1 to m, where m is number of probabilites entered.
	4. Assumes that at least 2 probabilites are entered. 

Note:
	1. Randomness is decided by seed inputted. Same seed will result in same result every time.
	2. Histogram is scaled based on "width" and frequency of mode. Any scaling factor with decimal points is rounded using round() function.
